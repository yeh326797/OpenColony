                                not just the greatest advantage but potentially the trickiest factor in managing a
                                business of any size. Inherent in the reality of human capital is that humans are the
                                capital, not the companies. Their value shines when they’re engaged in a humanistic,
                                considered context that supports their values, interests, and ambitions.
